        <h2>Games & Me</h2>

        <p>Games have always been a big part of my life. When I was a little kid, whenever we had a little extra money, my dad would rent an old Super Nintendo game system and some games from the convenience store up the road. We would spend all weekend playing Super Mario or the SNES Lion King game. My dad was would play Mario until he had the max 99 lives and then hand the controller over to me and my little sisters, who would promptly lose all his lives by playing badly.

        <p>A fun fact about me: I met my husband playing World of Warcraft!</p>
