//My favorites artists
console.log("One of my favorite artists is Artemisia Gentileschi. She was a 17th century Italian painter who was one of the first women artists to succeed in a male-dominated field. Her experiences as a female artist in the 17th century and a sexual assault survivor lead her to create the, in my opinion, most moving portrayal of Judith Slaying Holofernes.");

console.log("Another more recent favorite artist is Erika Williams aka HookieDuke. I especially love her detailed ink illustrations with minimal color use and they way she weaves her political beliefs and activism into her artwork.");

console.log("A local famous artist of mine is Stella Nall. I love her creative and whimsical way of depicting animals, her incorporation of beadwork into her paintings, and the way she weaves her identity as a first descendant of Apsáalooke tribe into her art.");
